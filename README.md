  # What is Next 
  Moving forward I would like to explore position in React. I believe this is an area I could improve in. I would also like to add more projects and possibly some more annimation to the elements to make the site a bit more dynamic.

  # What I learned 
  This assignment was a great opportunity to explore React. I really used it as an opportunity to add and remove elements to see how I can work with them. Through this I have been able to see what areas of creating a react site, require more attention. I also learned a lot about the necessary file structure and a window into the files that are previded with the react template, and what they do.
