# Professional Portfolio


  # Description: 
  
  This project will act as my professional portfolio, which will contain the projects and assignments created throughout the UTA coding Bootcamp. I have also included several projects that I have done as a graphic designer in the past. The site is a single page divided into three major parts. It has an opening that quickly directs the user to the projects they would like to view. I have divided both web development and graphic design into categories. When the user selects the grouping they'd like to view, they appear in the same layer.

# What did I Learn

I was a little too excited to dive into jquery for the functionality of this site. After problem-solving through some code, I realized it was best to keep some elements as html and css. For the first time, I worked with the toggle(), hide(), and show() methods in jquery. This was also the first time I put together a group of objects and pulled from them using a loop.

# What is the Next Step

For the next step I will be working on added projects from my graphic design career.
