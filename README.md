This project will act as my professional portfolio, which will contain the projects and assignments created throughout the UTA coding Bootcamp. I have also included several projects that I have done as a graphic designer in the past. The site is a single page divided into three major parts. It has an opening that quickly directs the user to the projects they would like to view. I have divided both web development and graphic design into categories. When the user selects the grouping they'd like to view, they appear in the same layer.

# What did I Learn

I was a little too excited to dive into jquery for the functionality of this site. After problem-solving through some code, I realized it was best to keep some elements as html and css. For the first time, I worked with the toggle(), hide(), and show() methods in jquery. This was also the first time I put together a group of objects and pulled from them using a loop.

# What is the Next Step

I need to resolve several issues with the site. It is currently not mobile responsive. I believe there is an issue with the layer positioning. When the site is not in full screen or shrunk down, the divs shift out of order. Currently, I have only one category working under html and css. I am looking forward to completing the other categories. I would also like the button to show in the active state. After seeing the cards come to life, I am unsure how I would like to display everything, I will be exploring bootstraps media-list next. Lastly, while I am very excited about the video at the top of the page, this layer needs some work; it seems to stretch the length of the page.
